Quantum Genetics is here!

1) Get the Qubits from random floats using IBM-Quantum.py or another Quantum bits provider.
2) Pass those floats into Qubits.go or use the provided Qubits.txt from this repository to generate more DNA from the Quantum mean.
3) Play with Quantum Music and Blast and/or blat from the Qubits_Split_*.DNA then cat the DNA files to a single DNA file or use the provided Qubits_Split.DNA provided in this repository.
4) Download a FASTA file for any genome of any living thing. (genbank or others)
5) Pass that to Tag.py after you download BioPython library to a Python virtual environment.
6) Obtain the frequencies in resonance with portions of the DNA of that organism in hertz with a specific count of occurence along the DNA chain. See *_Freq_Matched_DNA.Zero (parsed Human Genome & Mouse)

Have fun!
